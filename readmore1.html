    <span id="more"><img src="https://cdn.yashodahospitals.com/wp-content/uploads/Yashoda-Hospitals-employ-ECMO.jpg"/> doctors at Yashoda Hospitals, Secunderabad, have successfully revived a 58-year-old woman who had severe Covid-19 disease through ECMO machine, which functions like an artificial heart and lungs.

        The team of Doctors led by senior pulmonologist, Dr. Hari Kishan Gonuguntla and the intensive care team led by Dr. Venkata Ramana Kola, Dr. Sashi, Dr. Ashraff and others. The doctors employed Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy to treat the woman who hails from Korutla, Jagtial a city in Telangana
        
        The patient was admitted with severe Covid-19 symptoms and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), to the hospital’s ICU on the 16th of September. She was also a diabetic and was not maintaining oxygen levels above 70 per cent, forcing doctors to put her on a ventilator on September 17.
        
        However, the womans condition did not improve, as oxygen levels fluctuated between 80 percent and 90 per cent, prompting doctors to employ ECMO on September 19. Immediately after initiating ECMO, the woman’s oxygen levels started to improve.
        
        “ECMO is not easy because it is resource intensive and needs expert medical training, especially in times of Covid, where the healthcare workers are already overwhelmed with patient load. We have so far successfully discharged 10,000 Covid positive patients and despite the pressure, have an 
        exclusive team for ECMO and lung transplantation,” said Director, Yashoda Hospitals Groups, Dr. Pavan Gorukanti.
