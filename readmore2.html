      The Covid-19 pandemic has put a lot of pressure on healthcare institutions in Hyderabad to deliver quality services and save lives of critical patients. Corporate hospitals are no exceptions, as they too have to deal with sky-high expectations from the general public who has high regard for their infrastructure superiority, especially in the field of critical care.

One such private healthcare institution in Hyderabad is Yashoda Hospitals, which had to refocus its entire human resources pool, clinical and non-clinical talent and infrastructure to meet public expectations from patients during the time of the unprecedented pandemic.

The transition from being a top-notch multi-speciality hospital to a facility that provides critical care services to severe Covid-19 positive patients was full of challenges. To get a sense of the scale of Covid-19 operations and also dive into the details of preparations needed for the pandemic, Telangana Today interacted with Dr Pavan Gorukanti, Director, Yashoda Hospitals Group, and Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Specialist.
